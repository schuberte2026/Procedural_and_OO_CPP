//       a date and a description. This constructor needs to trim all
//       leading and trailing spaces from the description. You can use
//       .erase(0, 1) to remove the first character from a string if it is
//       a space (until some character is found that's not a space) and
//       then use .pop_back() to remove the last character until you reach
//       some character that is not a space. You can assume the description
//       has at least one letter in it.
